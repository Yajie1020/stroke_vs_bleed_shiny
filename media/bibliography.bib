    abstract = "{ContextPatients who have atrial fibrillation (AF) have an increased risk of
stroke, but their absolute rate of stroke depends on age and comorbid conditions.ObjectiveTo assess the predictive value of classification schemes that estimate
stroke risk in patients with AF.Design, Setting, and PatientsTwo existing classification schemes were combined into a new stroke-risk
scheme, the CHADS2 index, and all 3 classification schemes were
validated. The CHADS2 was formed by assigning 1 point each for
the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years or older,
and diabetes mellitus and by assigning 2 points for history of stroke or transient
ischemic attack. Data from peer review organizations representing 7 states
were used to assemble a National Registry of AF (NRAF) consisting of 1733
Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 95 years who had nonrheumatic AF and were
not prescribed warfarin at hospital discharge.Main Outcome MeasureHospitalization for ischemic stroke, determined by Medicare claims data.ResultsDuring 2121 patient-years of follow-up, 94 patients were readmitted
to the hospital for ischemic stroke (stroke rate, 4.4 per 100 patient-years).
As indicated by a c statistic greater than 0.5, the
2 existing classification schemes predicted stroke better than chance: c of 0.68 (95\\% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-0.71) for
the scheme developed by the Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (AFI) and c of 0.74 (95\\% CI, 0.71-0.76) for the Stroke Prevention
in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III scheme. However, with a c statistic of 0.82 (95\\% CI, 0.80-0.84), the CHADS2 index
was the most accurate predictor of stroke. The stroke rate per 100 patient-years
without antithrombotic therapy increased by a factor of 1.5 (95\\% CI, 1.3-1.7)
for each 1-point increase in the CHADS2 score: 1.9 (95\\% CI, 1.2-3.0)
for a score of 0; 2.8 (95\\% CI, 2.0-3.8) for 1; 4.0 (95\\% CI, 3.1-5.1) for 2;
5.9 (95\\% CI, 4.6-7.3) for 3; 8.5 (95\\% CI, 6.3-11.1) for 4; 12.5 (95\\% CI, 8.2-17.5)
for 5; and 18.2 (95\\% CI, 10.5-27.4) for 6.ConclusionThe 2 existing classification schemes and especially a new stroke risk
index, CHADS2, can quantify risk of stroke for patients who have
AF and may aid in selection of antithrombotic therapy.}",

abstract = "Background
Contemporary clinical risk stratification schemata for predicting stroke and thromboembolism (TE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are largely derived from risk factors identified from trial cohorts. Thus, many potential risk factors have not been included.
Methods
We refined the 2006 Birmingham/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stroke risk stratification schema into a risk factor-based approach by reclassifying and/or incorporating additional new risk factors where relevant. This schema was then compared with existing stroke risk stratification schema in a real-world cohort of patients with AF (n = 1,084) from the Euro Heart Survey for AF.
Results
Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes compared. Patients classified as high risk ranged from 10.2% with the Framingham schema to 75.7% with the Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age > 75, Diabetes, prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema categorized the largest proportion (61.9%) into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the Birmingham 2009 schema classified 15.1% into this category. The Birmingham 2009 schema classified only 9.2% as low risk, whereas the Framingham scheme categorized 48.3% as low risk. Calculated C-statistics suggested modest predictive value of all schema for TE. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally better (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS2. However, those classified as low risk by the Birmingham 2009 and NICE schema were truly low risk with no TE events recorded, whereas TE events occurred in 1.4% of low-risk CHADS2 subjects. When expressed as a scoring system, the Birmingham 2009 schema (CHA2DS2-VASc acronym) showed an increase in TE rate with increasing scores (P value for trend = .003).
Conclusions
Our novel, simple stroke risk stratification schema, based on a risk factor approach, provides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS2 schema, with low event rates in low-risk subjects and the classification of only a small proportion of subjects into the intermediate-risk category. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratification in patients with AF."

abstract = "Risk factors for stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation used in current risk stratification schema are derived largely from analyses of clinical trial cohorts, and the available data depend on the comprehensiveness of trial reports and whether specific risk factors were sought. The most commonly used schema is the Cardiac failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled] (CHADS2) score. Although simple and well validated, some limitations of CHADS2 this schema are apparent. A more recent approach to risk stratification of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation defines “major (definitive)” risk factors (eg, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack and age≥75 years) and “clinically relevant non-major” risk factors (eg, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, female gender, age 65-75 years, and atherosclerotic vascular disease). This scheme can be expressed as an acronym, CHA2DS2-VASc, denoting Cardiac failure or dysfunction, Hypertension, Age≥75 [Doubled], Diabetes, Stroke [Doubled]–Vascular disease, Age 65-74, and Sex category [Female]), whereby 2 points are assigned for a history of stroke or age 75 years or more and 1 point each is assigned for age 65 to 74 years, a history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiac failure, and vascular disease. Patients with 1 definitive risk factor or a patient with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 1 or more could be considered for oral anticoagulation, but a patient with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 is truly low risk and could be managed with no antithrombotic therapy. This would simplify our approach to thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation."
